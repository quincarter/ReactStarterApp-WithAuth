# React Starter App with Appwrite and Material UI

This app starter template uses Appwrite for a backend configuration (you need to configure it yourself.) [see here](./src/app-constants.ts).

This app is just a starting point for your application. Use it as you see fit if you need Auth and don't want to write it yourself.

This project uses Vite, React, React Router Dom, Material UI, and Appwrite Cloud (can be configured for Appwrite Docker Container self hosted as well)

## Getting started
